<!-- Is atla an anime? invincible? bojack horseman? adventure time? arknights? muse dash? <a href='https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=756755380'>ck2</a>? -->

I've limited this list to titles with a mal page, for which I've rated 10/10 (masterpiece).  These favorites are listed high to low, with a brief reflection.

<!-- Entries ending with (\*) indicate that I'm incredibly dissatisfied with what I've written, but don't have time to do the show justice. -->

Please note that your favorite anime was excluded from this list in order to personally spite you.

            When you turned shiki, you became exempt from god's judgement; but you kept your faith in god.

        <!-- I used to look down on moral arguments; they seemed terribly inconsistent as a basis for justifying behavior.  Here's the funny thing though: "justification for behavior should be consistent" is a moral argument.  I eventually just accepted that people simply act on their own values.  Quite straightforward when you say it out loud, but it's hard to find good works that express this concept well; aside from shiki, I haven't seen any anime that nails it. -->
        I've lived a very privileged life; I know this because I've come to appreciate reality as it is.
        Shiki shows the same respect for "the way things are"; in particular, it's an interesting exploration of the way people are.
        <!-- Shiki strongly resonates with my understanding of reality, in particular human nature. -->
        Though the story doesn't always promise a candid representation of its society, it is very comprehensive for such a large cast.  Even with fairly limited screentime, each character is able to showcase a unique and interesting aspect of ourselves.  The culmination of each individual's fears and motivations into such a thrilling tragic narrative makes Shiki one of my favorite stories of all time.  Also vampires are cool.

        Girls und panzer, ika musume, joshiraku, plastic neesan, prison school, mayoiga, another (kinda); so many great shows, but I'd say this is his best work.  I actually didn't like shirobako the first time; lost track of peoples' jobs and got bored.  My rewatch was completely different, not only because I'd learned some anime production basics, but because I'd started thinking about my own career.  Cutting out a place for yourself isn't easy, but watching cute anime characters find fulfilling creative work somehow takes the edge off a bit. <!-- <br>* -->

        <!-- Honestly, I don't know why I like hsl.  It's engaging and well-produced, but this doesn't make it special.  Unlike the other 10/10s there's no thesis that really satisfies me, yet I'm still compelled to put it high on my list.  This has been on my mind for years, but I still can't figure it out; maybe there's just something wrong with me.  I wanted to write something more meaningful, but for now all I can say is that it's a good story about finding utter completeness. -->
        What happens when we become complete?  Well according to hsl, that's illegal; reality will immediately try to strangle every piece of candy back out of your jar, and won't stop until you've cracked.  To paraphrase gasai yuno: the yandere is an expression of frustration with the world, that it refuses we find completion.  I realize reality is more bleak as opposed to bitter; satou didn't live to see that true completion never existed to begin with.  But all said and done, I just can't help myself from admiring her ideal.

        It's really something when an isekai anime convincingly births an economy by introducing bigmacs.  Log horizon sure has its issues (many issues), but its high points are some of the best moments in anime.  Instead of rehashing things, I'll just link this great analysis series called "dissecting log horizon" by the golden witch (hopefully these <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdOsb-MYEc0HUfrzXw2ZukWWYQD7x6ia8">links</a> still work).  Good academic content on good anime is hard to come by; highly recommend both the show and analysis. <!-- <br>* -->

        It's common knowledge that under our a.t. fields, we're all just the same orange fanta. But then what makes us different?  I think a big part is just where your metal egg drops, and who pushes the red button on the back. Also, this is literally the funniest show I've ever watched.  While a lot comes from the manga, I still think it really took someone like oikawa to nail the situational absurdity; watch konobi and outbreak company.

        <!-- <br> -->
        I feel urobuchi gen stories are interesting (madoka, fate/zero, saya no uta, etc.), but I can't imagine the characters outside the story; they act like literary devices.  Sybil is the exception.  We're shown that society is ultimately run by people making human decisions and mistakes, with human judgement and pride.  The psycho-pass universe became real to me, and stuck so strongly that I even watched all of seasons [...] and 3.  The movies were meh; the southeast asia one was good.

        <!-- <br> -->
        This entry isn't comparable/sortable with the others; I'm not really sure why mal lists this as anime.  This was my childhood; I remember watching a bunch of old chinese animations as a kid; stuff like three monks, afanti, supersoap, etc. Stories with sun wukong were lit; you really can't get more epic than smashing down the heavenly palace.
        齐天大圣: the great sage, equal of heaven.  I was always a bit bothered that this opens some power scaling issues between the taoist jade emperor and buddha, but whatever. Also, big honorable mention to the 三打白骨精 movie; absolutely terrifying yet beautiful.
